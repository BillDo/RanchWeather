# RanchWeather

A demo weather app written in Swift 3 to demonstrate various code patterns.

## Backstory

This is an app that was developed to demo various code patterns presented in a talk at [CocoaConf DC](http://cocoaconf.com/dc-2016/home). While I have done variations of this talk before, this is the first to embrace Swift 3.

## TODO

* Make slide visuals to express MultipleDataSources
* Record demo, post for feedback.
* Do localization
* Build out the Forms system. (might be dropped)
* Add animation of detail box.
* Add testing.
* Theme should be choosen based on clock.
